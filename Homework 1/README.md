# <p align="center"> Homework 1 </p>
In this homework, you will do some simple programming exercises to get familiar with the Ruby language. We will provide detailed automatic (hopefully) and personalized grading of your code.

## Part 1: Fun with Strings 
Introductory exercises in Ruby, focused on learning string manipulation, the use of regular expressions, and the construction of hashes.

## Part 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors
In a game of rock-paper-scissors, each player chooses to play Rock (R), Paper (P), or Scissors (S). The rules are: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, but Paper beats Rock. A rock-paper-scissors game is encoded as a list, where the elements are 2-element lists that encode a player’s name and a player’s strategy.

## Part 3: Anagrams
An anagram is a word obtained by rearranging the letters of another word. For example, "rats", "tars" and "star" are an anagram group because they are made up of the same letters.

## Part 4: Basic OOP
This part helps you organize your code using classes and objects, a crucial skill for writing maintainable and scalable software.

## Part 5: advanced OOP,metaprogramming, open classes and duck typing
Part 5 trains you to leverage Ruby’s advanced features, teaching you how to write elegant, expressive, and highly flexible code, which is essential for frameworks like Ruby on Rails.

## Part 6: advanced OOP,metaprogramming, open classes and duck typing, continued
Part 6 builds upon the advanced concepts introduced in Part 5, continuing the exploration of OOP, metaprogramming, open classes, and duck typing, with deeper focus on more complex implementations. The goal here is to further develop your understanding of Ruby’s unique programming paradigms through more challenging tasks.
